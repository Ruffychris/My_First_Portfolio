    <h1>Welcome to My First Cool Webpage!</h1>
    <p>Hello! This is my first attempt at creating a full HTML page. I'm excited to learn more about web development and build my own portfolio.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate learner who loves exploring technology, coding and solving problems. Web development is a field that allows creativity and logic to meet.</p>

    <h3>Why I Chose Web Development</h3>
    <p>Building websites and applications can impact many people and improve their experience online. I also enjoy seeing the instant results of my work in the browser.</p>

    <p>Through this journey, I aim to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually backend technologies to become a Full-stack developer.</p>
